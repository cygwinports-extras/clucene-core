full-featured, open-source indexing and searching API. It is written in 
C++.

CLucene is a port of the very popular Java Lucene text search engine
API. Specifically, CLucene is the guts of a search engine, the hard
stuff. You write the easy stuff, the UI and the process of selecting and
parsing your data files to pump them into the search engine yourself."
